		Provide counting and one-shot signal objects backed by wait queues.
		Disabling removes the signal primitive and related waitset support.

	help
		Upper bound on the number of simultaneously allocated signal handles
		Magnolia allows. Raising this improves scalability but increases registry
		memory and waitset tracking overhead.

config MAGNOLIA_IPC_SIGNAL_DIAGNOSTIC_VERBOSITY
	int "Signal diagnostic verbosity"
	range 0 3
	default 0
	depends on MAGNOLIA_IPC_SIGNALS_ENABLED
	help
		Advanced option. Higher values emit more diagnostics during signal
		state transitions. Useful for debugging waitset latency and timing issues.
