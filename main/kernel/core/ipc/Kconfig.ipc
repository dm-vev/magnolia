config MAGNOLIA_IPC_ENABLED
	bool "Enable Magnolia IPC subsystem"
	default y
	help
		Activate the Magnolia IPC runtime that powers signals, channels, event flags,
		waitsets, and shared-memory regions. Disable to reduce flash/RAM when only a
		subset of primitives is needed.

config MAGNOLIA_IPC_DEBUG
	bool "Enable IPC debug instrumentation"
	default n
	depends on MAGNOLIA_IPC_ENABLED
	help
		Toggle verbose tracing, assertions, and telemetry hooks for the IPC layer.
		Useful for debugging but increases code size and runtime overhead.

config MAGNOLIA_IPC_ENABLE_DIAG_DUMP
	bool "Enable IPC diagnostic dumps"
	default n
	depends on MAGNOLIA_IPC_ENABLED
	help
		Expose the Magnolia IPC diagnostic interfaces that read internal state
		into structures and optionally dump matching logs. Disable in space-critical
		builds.

config MAGNOLIA_IPC_SELFTESTS
	bool "Run Magnolia IPC self-tests at boot"
	default n
	depends on MAGNOLIA_IPC_ENABLED
	help
		Execute the Magnolia IPC regression suite during boot to validate signals,
		channels, event flags, shared memory, and waitset interactions.
